/*: # Comments
 
 The Swift compiler generates executable code from your source code.
 To accomplish this, it uses a detailed set of rules you will learn about in this book.
 Sometimes these details can obscure the big picture of why you wrote your code a certain way or even what problem you are solving.
 To prevent this, it’s good to document what you wrote so that the next human who passes by will be able to make sense of your work.
 That next human, after all, may be a future you.
 
 Like most other programming languages, Swift allows you to document your code using what are called comments.
 
 Use comments to include nonexecutable text in your code, as a note or reminder to yourself.
 Comments are ignored by the Swift compiler when your code is compiled.
 
 Comments in Swift are very similar to comments in C.
 Single-line comments begin with two forward-slashes (//).
 
 Multiline comments start with a forward-slash followed by an asterisk (/*) and end with an asterisk followed by a forward-slash (*/).
 */

// This is a comment. It is not executed.

// This is also a comment.
// Over multiple lines.

/* This is a comment .
 Over many..
 many...
 many lines.
