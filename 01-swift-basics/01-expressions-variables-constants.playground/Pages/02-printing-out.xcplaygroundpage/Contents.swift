/*: # Printing out
 
 It’s also useful to see the results of what your code is doing.
 In Swift, you can achieve this through the print(_:separator:terminator:) function.
 
 The print(_:separator:terminator:) function is a global function that prints one or more values to an appropriate output.
 In Xcode, for example, the print(_:separator:terminator:) function prints its output in Xcode’s “console” pane.
 The separator and terminator parameter have default values, so you can omit them when you call this function.
 By default, the function terminates the line it prints by adding a line break
